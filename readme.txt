A simple plugin that displays a customizable temporary page to visitors while you work on your site. Fully editable using native WordPress blocks.

== Description ==

Almost Ready Temporary Page is a simple plugin that shows a friendly temporary page to visitors while you work on your WordPress site. Unlike other plugins, it uses **native WordPress core blocks** — no custom builders or proprietary templates required.

**What it does:**

* Creates a simple temporary page automatically when activated
* Shows this page to all website visitors
* Lets you and other logged-in users access the site normally to keep working
* Uses your theme's styling so it looks consistent with your brand
* Completely customizable using WordPress's native block editor

**Key Features:**

* **Native Blocks** - Uses WordPress core blocks, no proprietary builders
* **Automatic Setup** - No complicated configuration needed
* **Smart Detection** - Visitors see the temporary page, logged-in users see the normal site
* **Fully Customizable** - Change text, colors, layout, add images using blocks
* **SEO Friendly** - Tells search engines not to index the temporary page
* **Theme Compatible** - Works with any WordPress theme
* **Clean Removal** - When deactivated, everything returns to normal

**Perfect for:**

* Website updates and maintenance
* Launching new websites while still working on them
* Making design changes without visitors seeing work-in-progress
* Temporary downtime periods
* Any time you need privacy while working on your site

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/almost-ready-temporary-page` or install through WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen
3. That's it! The temporary page is now live for visitors
4. To customize the page, go to Pages > All Pages and edit "Almost Ready"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the temporary page? =

Go to Pages > All Pages in your WordPress admin and click "Edit" on the "Almost Ready" page. You can change the text, add images, modify colors, and rearrange the layout using the block editor - just like editing any other page.

= Can I preview what visitors see? =

Yes! Either log out of WordPress or open a private/incognito browser window to see exactly what your visitors see.

= Will this affect my website permanently? =

Not at all. When you deactivate the plugin, your website returns to normal immediately. The temporary page becomes hidden (saved as a draft) but isn't deleted, so you can reactivate the plugin anytime.

= Can I still access my admin area? =

Absolutely. You and anyone else who is logged in can access everything normally - the admin area, your regular pages, everything. Only visitors who aren't logged in see the temporary page.

= What about search engines? =

The plugin tells search engines not to index the temporary page, so it won't hurt your SEO. When you deactivate it, your normal site pages will be crawled again.

= Do I need to know any code? =

Nope! Everything works automatically. If you want to customize the page, you can do it through the familiar WordPress page editor without touching any code.

= What makes this different from other maintenance plugins? =

Almost Ready Temporary Page is the only plugin that uses native WordPress core blocks for the temporary page. Other plugins use custom builders or proprietary templates. This means your page is lightweight, future-proof, and works exactly like any other WordPress page.
